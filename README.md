# Data Science Projects using ML
#### Welcome to my repo containing data science projects on various topics, showcasing knowledge in Machine Learning and the ability to apply it to real-world datasets.

## Projects:
- ### 1- [Titanic Survival Rate Analysis:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-ML/tree/c01383161f7cd9e7b5ae1b98a29f9b771ffd2ae2/Titanic%20Survival%20Analysis)
    - This project focuses on predicting the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic. Various features such as passenger fare, sex, age, etc. are considered, to make these predictions.
    - The primary method used for this analysis is the Decision Tree Classifier. This classifier is implemented both from scratch and using the sklearn.
    - The Decision Tree Classifier performed well on the test dataset with an accuracy of 82.5%. This suggests that the model was able to accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the given features with a high degree of accuracy.
- ### 2- [Telecom Churn Prediction Project:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-ML/tree/c01383161f7cd9e7b5ae1b98a29f9b771ffd2ae2/Telecom%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)
  - This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers leaving a company. High churn rates can negatively affect a companyâ€™s business performance and growth, making churn prediction a key metric for telecom companies.
  - The project uses various methods including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and KNN.
  - The trained model was able to predict the churnning rate of the Telecom Co. with the accuracy of 82%.
- ### 3- [Diamond Price Prediction:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-ML/tree/926268f51492bdcaddbc67039fe19a548ecbb895/Diamond%20Price%20Prediction)
  - This project focuses on predicting diamond prices considering various factors such as diamond's type of cut, carat, clarity, color, etc.
  - The primarily used methods in this project include Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
  - The trained model was able to predict the price of the diamond with the accuracy of 90%.

- ### 4- [House Price Prediction Project:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-ML/tree/1c5f31140f7fe3a6307333414467db02980688cd/House%20Price%20Prediction)
    - This project focuses on predicting house prices based on key features such as location, size, and property characteristics. Accurate house price predictions are critical for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
    - The project employs various methods, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to train predictive models.
    - The trained model achieves a high accuracy in estimating property prices, demonstrating the power of data-driven approaches in real estate valuation.
- ### 5- [Sleep and Lifestyle Analysis Project:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-ML/tree/1c5f31140f7fe3a6307333414467db02980688cd/Sleep%20and%20Lifestyle%20Analysis)
    - This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between sleep patterns and lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet, and screen time. Understanding these relationships is crucial for improving sleep quality and overall well-being.
    - The project employs various methods, including data visualization and correlation analysis, to uncover patterns and insights.
    - The findings of this project provide actionable insights into how lifestyle choices can impact sleep quality, promoting healthier habits and better sleep hygiene.
